The package requires HD Render Pipeline version 3.0.0. (preview) or later to work as intended.

If the demo scene is either too bright or entirely black (dark) then follow these steps"
1. Go to Windows > Package Manager > HD Render Pipeline and make sure it is 3.0.0 if not then update to it.
2. Edit > Render Pipeline > Single step upgrade script > Upgrade all Materials EmissionColor
and give it a minute or two to upgrade your materials. 

Render pipelines are being contantly updating and sometimes they change/break stuff because all render pipelines are in Preview (open beta).
