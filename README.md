# Basilisk VR Prototype
VR Prototype for CreativeXR


## Development ##

Built using Unity 2019.2.0b5. All Unity packages/dependencies are bundled with this repo.

This repo uses git LFS for large binary asset storage. Ensure that you clone using a client that supports git LFS.

The main production scene is `Assets/Basilisk/Scenes/Basilisk Master`


## UX ##

There are three scenes. At times, user interaction is required to progress.

 - Pre Scene 1: Hit space to start
 - Scene 1: When prompted the user must step toward the door in order to progress
 - Scene 2: When prompted the user needs to 'grab' the apple tree, and fold the terrain towards them in order to progress
 - Scene 3: No interaction required
